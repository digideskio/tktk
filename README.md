# What's the name mean?

In journalism, `TK` is used as a placeholder for facts or sections you don't have yet. For example:

````
Mr. Gerald held three titles during his time at he compnay: TK EXACT TITLES.
````

Depending on whom you ask, it either stands for `TO COME` if you like your acronyms phonetic or `TO KNOW` if you like them lexical.

### So what's that have to do with this?

Since this library is a work in progress, it's largely `TO COME`, but you use it `TO KNOW` things, and since it's a collection of utilities, you could say it's a toolkit of toolkits: The (T)ool(K)it Toolkit.
